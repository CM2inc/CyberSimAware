<h3>What is an SIM or Tabletop exercise?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>A simulated tabletop cyber exercise</strong> is a structured training activity designed to simulate and assess an organization's response to a cyber incident or security threat in a controlled, non-production environment. In this exercise, key stakeholders and team members gather around a table, either physically or virtually, to walk through various cybersecurity scenarios, such as a data breach, ransomware attack, or network intrusion. The primary goal of tabletop exercises is to improve an organization's preparedness and response capabilities in the face of real-world cyber threats.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>During the exercise</strong> participants engage in discussions, decision-making, and problem-solving activities related to the simulated scenario. They analyze the potential impact of the cyber incident, discuss response strategies, identify gaps in their cybersecurity posture, and determine ways to enhance incident response procedures. These exercises are typically conducted in a low-pressure environment, allowing teams to practice their roles and refine incident response plans without the stress of a live incident.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Tabletop exercises can cover</strong> various aspects of cybersecurity, such as incident detection, containment, communication, recovery, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. They help organizations assess their readiness, improve coordination among different teams, and enhance the effectiveness of their incident response processes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>In summary</strong> a simulated tabletop cyber exercise is a vital component of an organization's cybersecurity strategy, providing a safe and controlled environment for teams to prepare for and respond to cyber threats, ultimately strengthening their cybersecurity resilience.</p>
